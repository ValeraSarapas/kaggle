# Kaggle Competitions

This repository contains the solutions I created during the course [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai)
about deep learning.

Same of the generic files have been provided by the instructors: e.g `utils.py`, `vgg16.py`...

If you want to download the datasets from kaggle, please install the `kaggle-cli` and follow the
instructions. The `generate_submission` files assume you have the folders `train`, `test`, `valid` per each competition.
