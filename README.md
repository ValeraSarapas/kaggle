# Kaggle Competitions

This repository contains the solutions I created during the course [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai)
about deep learning.

Same of the generic files have been provided by the instructors: e.g `utils.py`, `vgg16.py`...

If order to download the datasets from kaggle, please install the `kaggle-cli` and follow the
instructions. The `generate_submission.py` files assume that you have the correct folders structure per each competition directory.

In order to setup the correct folders structure just copy the `create_dataset_structure.py` into a folder with the `train` and `test`
directories containing the images and execute it.
